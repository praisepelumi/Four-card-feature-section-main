## My process
  I built this site using a mobile first workflow. I built the mobile version using flex box, with a flex direction of column to align the info cards. For the desktop version, I used CSS grid to position the cards on the page. 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This what my first time using CSS grid. I learnt how to position elements using the CSS grid.


### Continued development
I want to focus more on using CSS grid in future projects as I have found it is very useful.


### Useful resources

- [CSS grid youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zBsdzdE4sM) - This helped me understand the basic positioning of CSS grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
